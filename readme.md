### Project Description

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Russian Doll Caching** in Laravel, a technique that involves nesting fragment caches for different parts of your view logic. By linking the cache keys to the model's `updated_at` timestamp, this approach ensures that caches are automatically invalidated (cachebusted) when the corresponding model is updated. This method provides an efficient and seamless caching solution for complex views, improving application performance while maintaining data freshness.
